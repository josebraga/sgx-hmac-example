## Set up

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx#install-the-intelr-sgx-sdk) to install the SDK if you only need to run in simulation mode (which is fine for this tutorial).

Follow [these instruction](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx#build-the-intelr-sgx-sdk-and-intelr-sgx-psw-package) to install both the SDK and the PSW for running in hardware mode.
